      <p class="abstract-text">
        <font color="000000"> Existing text-to-music generation models face two main limitations: they either only generate approximately 10 seconds of music, falling short of users' needs for longer compositions, or they require longer-duration datasets and increased output feature dimensions for training, leading to higher data and computational costs. 
          We systematically explored two training-free strategies for long-duration music generation based on diffusion models. 
          Both methods divide the task into multiple stages, with stage outputs concatenated to form the complete composition. 
The first, called the audio-prompt-guided strategy, employs the tail of audio features from the previous stage to serve as a prefix of the current stage, using masking techniques to guide the generation of the remainder of the current stage. 
          The second, the structure-guided strategy, leverages the structure of previous audio representations as intermediate states in the current stage generation, initiating the inference sampling process from the intermediate time step. 
          Our experiments demonstrate that existing short-form music generation systems are capable of generating long-duration music.</font>
